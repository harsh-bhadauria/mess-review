# Introduction
Welcome to the ultimate deep dive into our college dining experience— analyzing the mess reviews like never before! I'm conducting an in-depth mess review analysis using data collected by our very own college's mess committee. Dissecting daily ratings & uncovering trends over time, this project aims to analyse the ups and downs of our mess dining experience. From basic stats and time series trends to head-to-head mess hall showdowns, there's something in here for everyone. 
<em>Bon Appétit!</em>

# Expectations
 Some specific questions that I will try to analyze include (but are not limited to): 

- What is the overall quality of the mess food?
- Which one out of Mess 1 and Mess 2 has a higher overall rating?
- What is the frequency of the conducted polls?
- How does the day and time affect ratings?
- What was the impact of tender changes (if any)?

# Motivation
For this project, I wanted to focus on a dataset that's relevant to me and for our college community. Instead of analyzing a random dataset from the internet, I wanted to engage with something that reflects our daily experiences and offers actionable insights. After <del>a lot of</del> some brainstorming, I stumbled across polls that were conducted by the mess committee on WhatsApp (just goes to show that data is <em>everywhere</em> around you, you just have to look for it 🙂) and decided that this would be an interesting topic for analysis.
