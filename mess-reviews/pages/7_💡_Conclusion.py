            This mess review analysis has given a detailed look into the dining experiences within our college. We've broken down how the day of the week and meal times influence our ratings, revealing that certain days and meals consistently fare better or worse. We also compared Mess 1 against Mess 2, in the hopes to see if the tender changes lead to any changes. Further, we looked into outliers to shed light on those exceptional days when ratings soared or plummeted, offering insights about what works and what doesn't in our mess.
            
            The journey to a better mess experience is a collaborative effort. It involves feedback from students, adjustments by the mess staff, and an active mess committee. 
            Although the current ratings may not uphold our high standards, they do provide a baseline for further improvement.
            
            This project was meant for identifying the areas where we're lacking and then taking steps to counter those problems. By understanding patterns, we can make informed decisions to enhance our overall mess experience. I hope that the insights gained from this analysis are helpful, even if just a little bit.
            
            The new tender may not have had the drastic impact we thought it would, but it was a step in the right direction. The increased poll frequency is a step in the right direction. Perhaps this project is a step in the right direction. And if there's anything that I've learned from Gradient Boost, its that taking tiny steps in the right direction will eventually lead you to your desired destination.
