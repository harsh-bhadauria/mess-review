            Perhaps unsurprisingly, the overall stats don't look that good. 
            - The median for score is ~2.27, which is basically 2 stars or 'below average'
            - Around a third of the people give an 'okay' rating (3 stars)
            - The 'excellent' or 5 star option seems to be inflicted with outliers, because the mean is quite inflated as compared to the median (almost 4 times!)
            - On the contrary, there is one poll where 100% of the people gave a 1 star
            - Out of a 1000+ people present in the group, only ~100 people bother voting"""

            The number of votes per poll stat in particular has an interesting story to tell:
            - It starts off high, then sharply decreases and the poll frequency is also very low (the 2023 mess group was not that active)
            - A spike is observed when the even semester starts, and the polls are now being conducted much more frequently (the group now consists of ALL the college students)
            - However, it gradually decreases as the semester goes on.
            - Another surge is seen in votes when the tender changes, as people are more eager to give feedback on the new menu.
            - There are many tiny nuances that can be attributed to events like festivals, club activities and exam schedules, everything is interconnected!""",unsafe_allow_html=True)
