            From April 2024, a new tender was issued for the central mess and various stationary and grocery shops on the campus. Most importantly, the whole mess menu changes, all the mess staff changes & non-veg items were now on the menu, being served in mess 2 ONLY (Previously, both mess had the same menu but served on alternate days). Will this drastic change have drastic consequences?

            # Verdict
            After taking a look at the data, we can see that there's really not much difference in the score distributions. The quality of the food is essentially the same in both Mess 1 vs Mess 2. The tender changes did not have much impact on the ratings either.
            
            However, it is clear that more number of polls were conducted for Mess 2, leading to more accurate score ratings. The number of votes/poll also increased by about 10% for mess 2 (and *decreased* by about 12% for mess 1), so it seems like ***Mess 2 is in a better state now as compared to Mess 1***.
