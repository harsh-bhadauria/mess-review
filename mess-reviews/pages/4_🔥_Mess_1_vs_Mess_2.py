            After analyzing the distribution of various features, we are seeing a common pattern:

            - <p>There seems to be a higher number of polls conducted for mess 2 as compared to mess 1</p>
            - <p>Number of votes per poll are also higher for mess 2</p>
            - <p>Mess 1 does have slightly better stats overall, but that might just be because of lower number of polls and lower votes per poll</p>
