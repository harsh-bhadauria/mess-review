            All of the data has been collected from the polls conducted by the mess committee in the following WhatsApp groups:
            
            - <p>Central mess feedback (2023 batch): Data from 11-09-2023 to 17-01-2024</p>

            As far as I know, there is no simple way to convert WhatsApp poll data into plain text. There's <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/export-whatsapp-surveys/engdhlnghkdaoccckbbglafcanmpohob">this</a> chrome extension, but it only exports a single poll at a time. After a lot of searches that lead to no answers, I finally accepted the fact that I would have to type them manually... Yup. So I <em>manually typed 300+ samples</em> into an excel file and exported them as a csv file.
